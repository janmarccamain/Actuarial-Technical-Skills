# Actuarial-Technical-Skills

This repository showcases a range of actuarial technical skills developed through academic study, professional training, and hands-on projects. It includes work related to data analysis, statistical modeling, financial and insurance risk assessment, and actuarial reporting. Tools and programming languages such as R, Python, Excel, and VBA are used to perform tasks like experience studies, predictive modeling, reserving techniques, and automation of actuarial processes. 

The projects demonstrate a strong foundation in actuarial science, attention to detail, and a commitment to data-driven decision making.
